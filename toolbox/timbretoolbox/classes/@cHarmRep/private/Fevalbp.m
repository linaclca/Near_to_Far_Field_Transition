% function[y_v] = Fevalbp(bp, x_v)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
% ============
% From a set of time-pitch pairs in bp, estimate pitches at the times in x_v via
% linear interpolation. If x_v contains times greater than or less than all the
% times in bp for which there are pitches, these pitches are set to the last and
% first pitches in bp, respectively. 
%
% INPUTS:
% =======
% bp - A matrix of two columns where the first column is vector of times at
%      which a pitch was estimated and the second column is vector of pitches
%      (corresponding to the times).
% x_v - vector containing the times at which we like to have pitches
%
%
% OUTPUTS:
% ========
% y_v - A vector containing pitches at the times in x_v estimated by linearly
%       interpolating between two (pitch,time) pairs that flank the times. For
%       all values in x_v before (after) the first (last) value in bp, the first
%       (last) pitch value in bp is used for that time. In other words, the
%       extrapolation scheme is to continue the first and last pitches outside
%       the interval for which pitches have been defined.
