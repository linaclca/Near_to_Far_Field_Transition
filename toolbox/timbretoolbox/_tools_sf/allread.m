function [y,Fs,bits]=allread(file,ext,format)
%ALLREAD - Read any kind of data file. 
% Y=ALLREAD(FILE) loads a data file specified by the string FILE,
% returning the sampled data in y.  Unless FORMAT is specified,
% the file format is determined by heuristics (file suffix, magic
% words, presence of ascii numerical data, etc.).
% The syntax is similar to matlab's AUREAD and WAVREAD (.au, .snd
% and .wav formats are handled by those routines).  Other formats
% are handled by home-grown, possibly buggy code.  Caveat emptor!
% Beware that heuristics may spuriously trigger the wrong format.
%
% Formats currently handled are:
%	workspace: matlab array in workspace
%	AU: NeXT/SUN (handled by auread)
%	WAV: Microsoft WAVE (handled by wavread)
%	AIFF/AIFC
%	NIST
%	ESPS
%	WFF: Nottingham IHR's WFF format
%	IWAVE: John Cullings IWAVE format
%	ascii: (space,tab)/newline separated ascii 
%		(1st line of text, if present, is stripped)
%	csv: comma-separated ascii
%	double, float, long, short, char: native binary data
%	MACSND: macintosh 'snd' resources
%
% [Y,Fs,BITS]=ALLREAD(FILE) returns the sample rate (Fs) in Hertz
% and the number of bits per sample (BITS) used to encode the
% data in the file (if known).
%
% [...]=ALLREAD(FILE,N) returns only the first N samples from each
%	channel in the file.
% [...]=ALLREAD(FILE,[N1 N2]) returns only samples N1 through N2 from
%	each channel in the file.
% SIZ=ALLREAD(FILE,'size') returns the size of the audio data contained
% 	in the file in place of the actual audio data, returning the
%	vector SIZ=[samples channels].
% INFO=ALLREAD(FILE,'info') returns all available info about the file
%	in a structure.
% [...]=ALLREAD(FILE,[],FORMAT) specifies the file FORMAT rather than 
%	using heuristics.  
%
% See also MAP, AUREAD, WAVREAD and lower-level functions SF_FORMAT, 
% SF_INFO and SF_WAVE.
